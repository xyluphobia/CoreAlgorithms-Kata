# C++ Algorithms Kata Machine

The purpose of this project is twofold, it will:
- Help me learn how to write c++
- Teach me how to implement the following algorithms consistenty:
    - Binary Search
    - BFS
    - DFS
    - Sliding Window

## How it works?

Run command [TBD], a directory will be created in the format MonthYear if one does not already exist.
Within the directory will be a sub directory corresponding to the number of implementation attempts you have had this month.
Within each sub directory will be a C++ file for each of the above algorithms.

Upon completing your implementation of an algorithm, run the associated test with the following command [TBD]
!Tests only check that you output an expected result meaning that you can cheat to pass the tests by brute forcing the expected result. Do this if you wish however remember the point of this project is to learn so you are only cheating yourself.
