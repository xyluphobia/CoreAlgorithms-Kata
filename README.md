# C++ Algorithms Kata Machine

The purpose of this project is twofold, it will:
- Help me learn how to write c++
- Teach me how to implement the following algorithms consistenty:
    - Binary Search
    - DFS
    - BFS
    - Sliding Window

## How it works?

Run command [TBD], a directory will be created in the format MonthYear if one does not already exist.
Within the directory will be a sub directory corresponding to the number of implementation attempts you have had this month.
Within each sub directory will be a C++ file for each of the above algorithms.

Upon completing your implementation of an algorithm, run the associated test with the following command [TBD]
